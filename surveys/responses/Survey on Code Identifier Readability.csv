It's crucial to use identifiers consistently throughout the codebase. If getUserData() is used in one place, don't use fetchUserInfo() elsewhere for the same purpose.
Consistency in naming style (e.g., always using camelCase for methods) is vital.
Context:
The readability of an identifier can depend on its context. For example, i might be perfectly acceptable as a loop counter, but it's poor for a variable representing an index in a more complex algorithm.
Domain-Specific Terms:
Using terms that are common and well-understood within the specific domain of the software can greatly enhance readability for developers working on that project. However, it can hinder readability for those unfamiliar with the domain.
Abbreviations:
While some abbreviations are widely accepted (e.g., id for identifier, btn for button), excessive or obscure abbreviations can significantly reduce readability. It's important to use abbreviations sparingly and ensure they are unambiguous.
Pronounceability:
Identifiers that are easy to pronounce are often easier to remember and discuss, which can indirectly contribute to readability.
Clarity vs. Brevity:
There's often a trade-off between clarity and brevity. While shorter identifiers can be quicker to type, longer, more descriptive identifiers are generally more readable. It's important to strike a balance between the two.
Use of Acronyms:
Similar to abbreviations, acronyms should be used with caution. Common acronyms like HTTP or URL are fine, but less common ones should be avoided or spelled out for clarity.
Avoiding Negation in Boolean Names:
It's generally better to use positive boolean names (e.g., isActive, isEnabled) rather than negative ones (e.g., isNotActive, isDisabled). This makes the logic easier to follow.
Clarity of Purpose:
The identifier should clearly indicate the purpose of the variable, function, class, etc. This helps developers understand how the code works and reduces the need to refer to documentation or other code."
