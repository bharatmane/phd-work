Welcome! This repository is part of my PhD research in *program comprehension*, focusing on **identifier readability** across major programming languages (Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript).

With over **23 years of industry experience** and a strong belief in software craftsmanship, my research aims to bridge the gap between code and cognition â€” helping developers write code they (and others) can be proud of.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset: Multi-language Open Source Identifier Dataset

I've built and released a carefully curated dataset of **362,000+ unique identifiers** extracted from high-quality open-source projects across four major languages. This dataset is designed to aid research in:

- Identifier naming patterns  
- Readability prediction models  
- Cross-language analysis  
- Program comprehension tooling  
- Machine learning applications in SE
